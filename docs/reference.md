### Lime Base

The Lime Base class was adapted from the Captum Lime implementation. This adaptation builds upon the original work, extending and customizing it for specific use cases within this project. To see the original implementation, please refer to the [Captum repository](https://captum.ai/api/_modules/captum/attr/_core/lime.html#LimeBase).
